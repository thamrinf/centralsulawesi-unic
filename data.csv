It presents feedback gathered from communities affected during the natural disaster and is intended to help humanitarian responders make decisions and adapt programming as disaster response efforts progress. The tool is designed to help humanitarian responders make decisions and adapt programming by providing insights into what communities are saying as the response progresses. The bulletin is informed by inter-agency community engagement efforts including discussion with affected people, community focus group discussion and radio programmes.

UNODC,Critical Incident Management for Correctional Facility,,"- Securing a critical facility like a corrections facility is not consideration as we saw in the recent Palu incident. In the aftermath of the tsunami, a riot broke out in Donggala Prison because around 300 inmates became angry at not being released and burned the prison after the warden refused to grant their request. The inmates had requested to leave the facilities to look for their family member who were affected by the earthquake. Reportedly around 100 inmates fled the Donggala prison. In Palu, the Head of the Prison cannot hold the inmates at the facility because the prison collapsed after the quake. Additionally, corrections staff abandoned the facility to look after their families in most cases leaving the warden to cajole 1200 inmates not to “escape.” The violent extremist prisoners who were serving their sentence in Palu Prison was moved a couple of days before the disaster, thus avoiding the risk of having a violent extremist on the loose in a chaotic situation. In respond to such situation, UNODC and Directorate General of Corrections (DGC) have been jointly developing Standard Operation Procedures and recovery plan for correctional facility.",PALU,"Directorate General of Corrections, Ministry of Law and Human Rights",PALU,-0.8917,119.8707
